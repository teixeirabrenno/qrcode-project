## My process

- I started by analizing the content to see how many divs I would need and setting the semantics in the best way possible. The CSS was simple. I know this could have been done faster, but I managed to finish the project in about 30 minutes. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was simple. The only part that I forgot how to do it was how to add the specified font to my project. However, I knew where to find the solution for it and got it done with no further issues.

### Continued development

Although this challenge was simple, I still struggle a little bit to organize things on the screen when there are a lot of elements to be dealt with. This was my first challenge at Frontend Mentor and I'm sure I will be able to practice and upgrade my skills with the next challenges.
